The above list is not exhaustive, and the Company faces additional challenges and risks. Investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the Company's securities. 

Risk Factors 

The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See "Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results" below. 

Risks Related to the Company's Business 

The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely affected. 

Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company's marketing of human health and animal health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent protection is available. 

Even if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important for the Company's business to defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products. The Company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against the Company. The Company defends its patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 10. "Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities" below. In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated NDAs with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by the Company. The Company normally responds by defending its patent, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent 

s 

infringement. Patent litigation and other challenges to the Company's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the Company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party patents may prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. 

Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect the Company's results of operations. Further, court decisions relating to other companies' patents, potential legislation in both the United States and certain foreign markets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection. 

If one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available. The Company's results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until the Company has launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively affect product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products. 

A chart listing the patent protection for certain of the Company's marketed products, and U.S. patent protection for candidates in Phase 3 clinical development is set forth above in Item 1. "Business  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses." 

As the Company's products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products. 

The Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection for one of the Company's products typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute significantly to the Company's sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, the patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for NuvaRing expired in April 2018 and generic competition began in December 2019. The Company experienced a rapid and substantial decline in U.S. NuvaRing sales in 2020 as a result of this generic competition. In addition, Januvia and Janumet will lose market exclusivity in the United States in January 2023. Januvia will lose market exclusivity in the EU in September 2022. Finally, the SPC that provides market exclusivity for Janumet in the EU expires in April 2023. The Company anticipates sales of Januvia and Janumet in these markets will decline substantially after the loss of market exclusivity. 

Key products generate a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the Company's key products, such as Keytruda, Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Januvia , Janumet , and Bridion . In particular, in 2020, the Company's oncology portfolio, led by Keytruda, represented the vast majority of the Company's revenue growth. As a result of the Company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products. 

s 

The Company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection. 

In order to remain competitive, the Company, like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. As a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested. 

For a description of the research and development process, see Item 1. "Business  Research and Development" above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. Therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing. 

The Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks. 

Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following: 

 findings of ineffectiveness, superior safety or efficacy of competing products, or harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing; 

 failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, including delays in the approval of new products and new indications, or the anticipated labeling, and uncertainties about the time required to obtain regulatory approvals and the benefit/risk standards applied by regulatory agencies in determining whether to grant approvals; 

 failure in certain markets to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product; 

 lack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing costs or other factors; and 

 preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others. 

s 

In the future, if certain pipeline programs are cancelled or if the Company believes that their commercial prospects have been reduced, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions or certain collaborations. 

Failure to successfully develop and market new products in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products. 

The Company faces continued pricing pressure globally and, particularly in mature markets, from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company's sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency, including new laws as noted above in Item 1. "Competition and the Health Care Environment." Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the United States, larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization. 

In order to provide information about the Company's pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the United States. The report provides the Company's average annual list price and net price increases across the Company's U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2020, the Company's gross U.S. sales were reduced by 45.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. 

Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. The next government-mandated price reduction will occur in April 2021 and is expected to impact many Company products. 

The Company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future. 

The uncertainty in global economic conditions together with cost-reduction measures being taken by certain governments could negatively affect the Company's operating results. 

Uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect the Company's business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers may be able or willing to pay for the Company's products or by reducing the demand for the Company's products, which could in turn negatively impact the Company's sales and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

As discussed above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's revenue performance in 2020 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third-parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of these actions, and additional actions in the future, will continue to negatively affect revenue performance. 

s 

If credit and economic conditions worsen, the resulting economic and currency impacts in the affected markets and globally could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results. 

The Company faces intense competition from lower cost generic products. 

In general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU. In the United States and the EU, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures that encourage the use of generic and biosimilar products. Although it is the Company's policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to the Company's products can arise at any time, and the Company's patents may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for its products. 

Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing the Company's sales of that product. Availability of generic substitutes for the Company's drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the Company's sales and, potentially, its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company faces intense competition from competitors' products. 

The Company's products face intense competition from competitors' products. This competition may increase as new products enter the market. In such an event, the competitors' products may be safer or more effective, more convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectively marketed and sold than the Company's products. Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors' branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the Company's products. As a result, if the Company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively impact product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products. 

The global COVID-19 pandemic is having an adverse impact on the Company's business, operations and financial performance. The Company is unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact its business, operations, financial performance, results of operations, and financial condition. 

The Company's business and financial results were negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. The continued duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's results in 2021 will depend on future developments, beyond the Company's knowledge or control, including, but not limited to, the duration of the outbreak, its severity, the success of actions taken to contain or prevent the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Company's business in numerous ways. As expected, within the Company's human health business, revenue was negatively impacted by reduced access to health care providers given social distancing measures, which negatively affected vaccine and oncology sales in particular. The estimated overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to Merck's revenue for the full year 2020 was approximately $2.5 billion, largely attributable to the Pharmaceutical segment, with approximately $50 million attributable to the Animal Health segment. 

Roughly two-thirds of Merck's Pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician-administered products, which, despite strong underlying demand, have been affected by social distancing measures, fewer well visits and delays in elective surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts, as well as the prioritization of COVID-19 patients at health care providers, have resulted in reduced administration of many of the Company's human health products, in particular for its vaccines, including Gardasil 9, as well as for Keytruda and Implanon/ 

s 

Nexplanon . In addition, declines in elective surgeries negatively affected the demand for Bridion . However, sales of Pneumovax 23 have increased due to heightened awareness of pneumococcal vaccination. 

Merck believes that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of COVID-19, but the Company's assumption is that ongoing residual negative impacts will persist, particularly during the first half of 2021 and most notably with respect to vaccine sales, with the impact expected to be more acute in the United States. For the full year of 2021, Merck assumes an unfavorable impact to revenue of approximately 2% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which relates to Pharmaceutical segment sales. In addition, for the full year of 2021, with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck expects a net negative impact to operating expenses, as spending on the development of its COVID-19 antiviral programs is expected to exceed the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the Company's efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact will also depend on factors beyond the Company's knowledge or control, including the duration of the COVID-19 virus as well as governmental and third-party actions taken to contain or prevent its spread, treat the virus and mitigate its public health and economic effects. In addition, any future pandemic, epidemic or similar public health threat could present similar risks to the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 

The extent of the Company's operations outside the United States is significant. Risks inherent in conducting a global business include: 

 changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets; 

 multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products in key markets; 

 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the United States or other governments; 

 foreign exchange fluctuations; 

 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and 

 possible nationalization and expropriation. 

In addition, there may be changes to the Company's business and political position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. 

Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect the Company's ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. 

The Company's success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. 

In the past, the Company has experienced difficulties and delays in manufacturing certain of its products, including vaccines. 

Merck has, in the past, experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain of its products, including vaccines. For example, in 2020 the Company issued a product recall for Zerbaxa following the identification of product sterility issues. The Company may, in the future, experience other difficulties and delays in manufacturing its products, such as (i) failure of the Company or any of its vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to 

s 

manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; (ii) delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for the Company's products; and (iii) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply. In addition, the Company could experience difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. Manufacturing difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales and reputational harm to the Company. 

The Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of its investments in emerging markets. 

The Company has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets. However, there is no guarantee that the Company's efforts to expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. In order for the Company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and retain qualified personnel. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and, if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot offset the devaluations, the Company's financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected. 

The Company's business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company's overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business outside the United States has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company's business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company's currently marketed products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. As noted above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," pricing pressure in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs, including implementing health care reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, where available. In 2017, the Chinese government updated the NRDL for the first time in eight years. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2020, drugs were added to the NRDL through double-digit price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government's VBP program. In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the first three rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward. In addition, the Company anticipates that the reported inquiries made by various governmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in China may continue. 

For all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. However, at the same time macro-economic growth of selected emerging markets is expected to outpace Europe and even the United States, leading to significant increased headcount spending in those countries and access to innovative medicines for patients. A failure to maintain the Company's presence in emerging markets could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. 

The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all sales are denominated in currencies of the local jurisdiction. Additionally, the Company has entered and will enter into business development transactions, borrowings or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure. 

Since the Company cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation could negatively affect the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

s 

In order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, the Company will from time to time enter into hedging agreements. While hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful. 

Certain of the Company's interest rate derivatives and investments are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and a portion of Merck's indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which will cause LIBOR to cease to exist entirely in the future. While the Company expects that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to its termination, the Company cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, which could include an increase in interest expense and may also require the amendment of contracts that reference LIBOR. 

Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. 

Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions. 

Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could materially adversely affect the Company's business. 

The Company depends on third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for key aspects of its business including development, manufacture and commercialization of its products and support for its information technology (IT) systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to the Company or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between the Company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. 

Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. 

Future sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as African Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. As the Animal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations would also become more significant. 

Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition. 

The successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including: 

 There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the United States and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs. 

s 

 The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the United States, a BLA, including both pre-clinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial lot. 

 Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide pre-clinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the products before and after such changes. 

 Biologics and vaccines are frequently costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically. In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines. 

 The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. Any of these events could result in substantial costs.

The health care industry in the United States has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action. 

As discussed above "Competition and the Health Care Environment," the Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by the Executive branch, Congress and state legislatures. 

In 2010, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in the form of the ACA. Various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. The ACA increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. 

The ACA also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% of the cost of medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called "donut hole"). In 2020, the Company's revenue was reduced by approximately $700 million due to this requirement. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. In 2020, the Company recorded $85 million of costs for this annual fee. 

In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. More recently, although CMS previously declined to define what constitutes a product "line extension" (beyond the statutory definition), CMS issued a new rule on December 21, 2020 that will significantly expand the definition of the term "line extension" as of January 1, 2022 to include a broad range of products, including products reflecting new strengths, dosage forms, release mechanisms, and routes of administration. This expanded definition will increase the number of drugs subject to a higher Medicaid rebate. Effective January 1, 2023, this final rule also changes the way that manufacturers must calculate Best Price, in relation to certain patient support programs, including coupons, which also may result in an increase in 

s 

the Company's Medicaid rebates. The impact of these and other provisions in this final rule could adversely impact the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

As discussed above in "Competition and the Health Care Environment," in November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2023, eliminate the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. 

On November 20, 2020, CMS also issued the MFN Rule, which was intended to be effective January 1, 2021, to institute a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs and biologic products covered by Medicare Part B in which Medicare would reimburse no more than the "most favored nation price," meaning the lowest price after adjusting for volume and differences in gross domestic product, for the top fifty Part B reimbursed products, which includes Keytruda , sold in 22 member countries of the OECD, rather than use the current Average Sales Price ("ASP")-based payment framework for certain physician-administered drugs. Implementation of the MFN Rule could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The FDA also recently issued rulemaking allowing the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Native American tribes recognized under the rule, and, in certain future circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers. The FDA also recently released a final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, and combination products that were manufactured abroad and authorized and intended for sale in a foreign country. These changes, if they become effective, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

Several organizations, including two trade groups of which Merck is a member, have filed suit challenging the MFN Rule. Those lawsuits remain pending with a preliminary injunction having been entered in one of the cases. A trade organization in which Merck is a member brought suit, which is pending, in federal district court challenging the commercial importation rule. 

The Company cannot predict the likelihood of these regulations becoming effective or what additional future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, will occur, however, these changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The Company's products, including products in development, cannot be marketed unless the Company obtains and maintains regulatory approval. 

The Company's activities, including research, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, Japan and China. In the United States, the FDA administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. Regulation outside the United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, including in Japan and China, have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product. 

Even if the Company is successful in developing new products, it will not be able to market any of those products unless and until it has obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new products. Once obtained, the Company must maintain approval as long as it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where approval is required. The Company's failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the products in that jurisdiction. The Company would not be able to realize revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval. 

s 

Developments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of the Company's products. 

Even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for the Company's products, including the following: 

 results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies; 

 the re-review of products that are already marketed; 

 the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed; 

 changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labeling changes; and 

 scrutiny of advertising and promotion. 

In the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of the Company and of competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general that have negatively affected the sales of such products. In addition, increased scrutiny of the outcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in market reaction. Further, these matters often attract litigation and, even where the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may be needed to respond. 

In addition, following in the wake of product withdrawals and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMA, Japan's PMDA and China's NMPA have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications. 

If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the Company's products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the Company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. Further, in the current environment in which all pharmaceutical companies operate, the Company is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products, research and/or marketing activities. In addition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace. 

The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations. 

The Company is currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect the business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company; these laws and regulations include (i) additional health care reform initiatives in the United States or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; (ii) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-bribery and corruption laws; (iii) new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, and access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iv) changes in intellectual property laws; (v) changes in accounting standards; (vi) new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the EU and the United States; (vii) legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing of pharmaceutical or vaccine products; (viii) emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to health care professionals; (ix) environmental regulations; and (x) the potential impact of importation restrictions, embargoes, trade sanctions and legislative and/or other regulatory changes. 

s 

The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required for determining the Company's tax liabilities, and the Company's tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. In addition, the Company may be negatively affected by changes in tax laws, or new tax laws, affecting, for example, tax rates, and/or revised tax law interpretations in domestic or foreign jurisdictions. 

Product liability insurance for products may be limited, cost prohibitive or unavailable. 

As a result of a number of factors, product liability insurance has become less available while the cost of such insurance has increased significantly. The Company is subject to a substantial number of product liability claims. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 10. "Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities" below for more information on the Company's current product liability litigation. With respect to product liability, the Company self-insures substantially all of its risk, as the availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. The Company will continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk; however, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully cover product liabilities that may arise. 

Risks Related to Technology 

The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. In 2017, the Company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations. The Company could be a target of future cyber-attacks. 

The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud service providers (collectively, IT systems) to conduct critical operations. Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties to assist in conducting the Company's business. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or accidental means by the Company's employees, third parties with authorized access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company's IT systems or third-party providers' IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. Misuse of any of these IT systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, or other confidential business information. The Company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes; the use of which can create new risks. 

In 2017, the Company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations, and resulting losses. 

The Company has implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar attacks in the future, and also is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the Company's resiliency against future cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 attack. The objective of these efforts is not only to protect against future cyber-attacks, but also to improve the speed of the Company's recovery from such attacks and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. 

Although the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions, including the 2017 cyber-attack, on the Company's operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company IT systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing 

s 

basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect its data and IT systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be successful in preventing disruptions to the Company's operations, including its manufacturing, research and sales operations. Such disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from the Company's or the Company's third-party providers' databases or IT systems and have in the past and could in the future also result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the Company and substantial remediation costs. 

Social media platforms present risks and challenges. 

The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain social media channels could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about the Company or its products on any social networking platforms could damage the Company's reputation, brand image and goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information by the Company's workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. Although there is an internal Company Social Media Policy that guides employees on appropriate personal and professional use of social media about the Company, the processes in place may not completely secure and protect information. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand also presents new challenges. 

Risks Related to the Proposed Spin-Off of Organon 

The proposed Spin-Off of Organon may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results. 

In February 2020, the Company announced its intention to Spin-Off products from its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company, which has been named Organon & Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution is expected to qualify as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction is expected to be completed late in the second quarter of 2021. Completion of the Spin-Off will be subject to a number of factors and conditions, and there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to complete the Spin-Off on the terms or on the timeline that was announced, if at all. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed Spin-Off, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances. In addition, consummation of the proposed Spin-Off will require final approval from the Company's Board of Directors. 

The costs to complete the proposed Spin-Off will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the Spin-Off of Organon. 

The Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the Spin-Off. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the Spin-Off. The anticipated benefits of the Spin-Off are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. 

Following the Spin-Off, the price of shares of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly. 

The Company cannot predict the effect of the Spin-Off on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the Spin-Off. In addition, the price of Merck's common stock may be more volatile around the time of the Spin-Off. 

There could be significant income tax liability if the Spin-Off or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

The Company expects that prior to completion of the Spin-Off it will receive an opinion from its U.S. tax counsel that concludes, among other things, that the Spin-Off of all of the outstanding Organon shares to Merck 

s 

shareholders and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Merck and its shareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Organon common stock. Any such opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Accordingly, while the Company believes the risk is low, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-Off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Merck and Organon regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion. 

If the proposed Spin-Off ultimately is determined to be taxable, which the Company believes is unlikely, the Spin-Off could be treated as a taxable dividend to Merck's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Merck's shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Merck would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of Organon common stock exceeds Merck's tax basis in such stock on the date of the Spin-Off. 

Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results 

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) 

This report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company's growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs and include statements related to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following: 

 Competition from generic and/or biosimilar products as the Company's products lose patent protection. 

 Increased "brand" competition in therapeutic areas important to the Company's long-term business performance. 

 The difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new product development. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is inherently uncertain. A drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and one or more late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval. New product candidates may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market because of efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture and/or the infringement of patents or intellectual property rights of others. Furthermore, the sales of new products may prove to be disappointing and fail to reach anticipated levels. 

 Pricing pressures, both in the United States and abroad, including rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general. 

 The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemic, epidemic, or similar public health threat, on the Company's business, operations and financial performance. 

 Changes in government laws and regulations, including laws governing intellectual property, and the enforcement thereof affecting the Company's business. 

s 

 Efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales. 

 Significant changes in customer relationships or changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage. 

 Legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability of existing products. 

 Cyber-attacks on the Company's or third-party providers' information technology systems, which could disrupt the Company's operations. 

 Lost market opportunity resulting from delays and uncertainties in the approval process of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. 

 Increased focus on privacy issues in countries around the world, including the United States and the EU. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the Company's business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states in the United States requiring security breach notification. 

 Changes in tax laws including changes related to the taxation of foreign earnings. 

 Changes in accounting pronouncements promulgated by standard-setting or regulatory bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC, that are adverse to the Company. 

 Economic factors over which the Company has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 

 The proposed Spin-Off might be delayed or the costs to complete the Spin-Off might be more significant than expected. 

This list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. See "Risk Factors" above.
