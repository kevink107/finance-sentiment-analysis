Description of Merck's Business 

Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. The Company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and include four operating segments, which are the Pharmaceutical, Animal Health, Healthcare Services and Alliances segments. The Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments are the only reportable segments. 

The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. 

The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers. 

The Healthcare Services segment provides services and solutions that focus on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients. The Company has recently sold certain businesses in the Healthcare Services segment and is in the process of divesting the remaining businesses. While the Company continues to look for investment opportunities in this area of health care, the approach to these investments has shifted toward venture capital investments in third parties as opposed to wholly-owned businesses. 

The Alliances segment primarily includes activity from the Company's relationship with AstraZeneca LP related to sales of Nexium and Prilosec, which concluded in 2018. 

Planned Spin-Off of Women's Health, Legacy Brands and Biosimilars into New Company 

In February 2020, Merck announced its intention to spin-off products from its women's health, trusted legacy brands and biosimilars businesses into a new, yet-to-be-named, independent, publicly traded company (NewCo) through a distribution of NewCo's publicly traded stock to Company shareholders. The distribution is expected to qualify as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The legacy brands included in the transaction consist of dermatology, pain, respiratory, and select cardiovascular products including Zetia and Vytorin , as well as the rest of Merck's diversified brands franchise. Merck's existing research pipeline programs will continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. NewCo will have development capabilities initially focused on late-stage development and life-cycle management, and is expected over time to develop research capabilities in selected therapeutic areas. The spin-off is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, subject to market and certain other conditions. 

Overview 

Merck's performance during 2019 demonstrates execution in both commercial and research operations driven by a focus on key growth drivers and innovative pipeline investment reinforcing the Company's science-led strategy. In 2019, Merck enhanced its portfolio and pipeline with external innovation, increased investment in new capital projects focused primarily on expanding manufacturing capacity across Merck's key businesses, and returned capital to shareholders. 

Worldwide sales were $46.8 billion in 2019 , an increase of 11% compared with 2018 , including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven primarily by Merck's growth pillars of oncology, human health vaccines, certain hospital acute care products, and animal health. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the ongoing effects of generic competition, particularly in the diversified brands and cardiovascular franchises, as well as by competitive pressure, particularly in the diabetes and virology franchises. 

Merck continued to prioritize business development aimed at enhancing its portfolio and strengthening its pipeline by executing several business development transactions in 2019. To expand its oncology presence, Merck completed the acquisitions of Peloton Therapeutics, Inc. (Peloton), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel small molecule therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, and Immune Design, a late-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease. Merck also announced an agreement to acquire ArQule, Inc. (ArQule), a biopharmaceutical company focused on kinase inhibitor discovery and development for the treatment of cancer and other diseases; the acquisition closed in January 2020. To augment Merck's animal health business, the Company acquired Antelliq Group (Antelliq), a leader in digital animal identification, traceability and monitoring solutions. 

During 2019, the Company received numerous regulatory approvals and progressed many important pipeline candidates through clinical development. Within oncology, Keytruda received multiple additional approvals in the United States, European Union (EU), China and Japan as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), esophageal cancer and in combination with axitinib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), in combination with chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and in combination with Lenvima for endometrial carcinoma. Lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of appropriate patients with germline BRCA -mutated (g BRCA m) pancreatic cancer and European Commission (EC) approval for use in certain patients with advanced ovarian cancer and advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 

In addition to oncology, the Company received regulatory approvals in the hospital acute care and vaccines therapeutic areas. The FDA approved Recarbrio (imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam) for injection, a new combination antibacterial for the treatment of certain patients with complicated urinary tract infections caused by certain Gram-negative microorganisms. Recarbrio was approved by the EC in February 2020. The FDA and EC also approved expanded indications for Zerbaxa for the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms. Additionally, Ervebo (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live), a vaccine for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adults, was approved in the United States and received conditional approval in the EU . 

In addition to the recent regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company advanced its late-stage pipeline, particularly in oncology, with several regulatory submissions for Keytruda , Lynparza and Lenvima in the United States and internationally. The Company's Phase 3 oncology programs include Keytruda in the therapeutic areas of biliary tract, breast, cervical, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, mesothelioma, nasopharyngeal, ovarian, prostate and small-cell lung cancers; Lynparza in combination with Keytruda for non-small cell lung cancer; and Lenvima in combination with Keytruda for bladder, endometrial, head and neck, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancers. Additionally, the Company has candidates in Phase 3 clinical development in several other therapeutic areas, including V114, an investigational polyvalent conjugate vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease that received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes in pediatric patients (6 weeks to 18 years of age) and in adults; MK-7264, gefapixant, a selective, non-narcotic, orally-administered P2X3-receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of refractory, chronic cough; MK-8591A, islatravir, an investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) in combination with doravirine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; and MK-1242, vericiguat, an investigational treatment for heart failure being developed in a collaboration (see "Research and Development" below). 

The Company is allocating resources to effectively support its commercial opportunities in the near term while making the necessary investments to support long-term growth. Research and development expenses in 2019 reflect higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. 

In November 2019, Merck's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.61 per share from $0.55 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. During 2019 , the Company returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 

Earnings per common share assuming dilution attributable to common shareholders (EPS) for 2019 were $3.81 compared with $2.32 in 2018 . EPS in both years reflects the impact of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, as well as restructuring costs and certain other items. Certain other items in 2019 include a charge related to the acquisition of Peloton and in 2018 include a charge related to the formation of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes these items, was $5.19 in 2019 and $4.34 in 2018 (see "Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS" below). 

Pricing 

Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company's revenue performance in 2019 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third-parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect revenue performance.

U.S. plus international may not equal total due to rounding. 

Worldwide sales grew 11% in 2019 driven primarily by higher sales in the oncology franchise reflecting strong growth of Keytruda , as well as increased alliance revenue related to Lynparza and Lenvima. Also contributing to revenue growth were higher sales of vaccines, including Gardasil/Gardasil 9, Varivax , ProQuad and M&#8209;M&#8209;R II, as well as increased sales of certain hospital acute care products, including Bridion. Higher sales of animal health products also drove revenue growth in 2019 . 

Sales growth in 2019 was partially offset by the effects of generic competition for cardiovascular products Zetia and Vytorin , hospital acute care products Invanz , Cubicin and Noxafil , oncology product Emend , and products within the diversified brands franchise, as well as biosimilar competition for immunology product Remicade. The diversified brands franchise includes certain products that are approaching the expiration of their marketing exclusivity or that are no longer protected by patents in developed markets. Lower sales of diabetes products Januvia and Janumet and HIV products Isentress/Isentress HD also partially offset revenue growth in 2019 . 

Sales in the United States grew 12% in 2019 driven primarily by higher sales of Keytruda , combined sales of ProQuad , M-M-R II and Varivax , and Bridion , as well as higher alliance revenue from Lenvima and Lynparza. Revenue growth was partially offset by lower sales of Januvia, Janumet , Invanz , Emend , Isentress/Isentress HD , Cubicin and Noxafil . 

International sales grew 10% in 2019 . Performance in international markets was led by China, which had total sales of $3.2 billion in 2019 , representing growth of 47% compared with 2018 , including a 7% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The increase in international sales primarily reflects growth in Keytruda , Gardasil/Gardasil 9, combined sales of ProQuad , M-M-R II and Varivax , as well as higher alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima. Sales growth was partially offset by lower sales of Zetia , Vytorin , Zepatier, Remicade , and products within the diversified brands franchise. International sales represented 57% of total sales in both 2019 and 2018 . 

See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for details on sales of the Company's products. A discussion of performance for select products in the franchises follows.

(1) Alliance revenue represents Merck's share of profits, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Keytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy that has been approved for the treatment of multiple malignancies including cervical cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), esophageal cancer, gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, HNSCC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NSCLC, SCLC, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), RCC and urothelial carcinoma. The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types (see "Research and Development" below). 

In January 2020, the FDA approved Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) based on the results of the KEYNOTE-057 trial. 

In July 2019, the FDA approved Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] &#8805;10) as determined by an FDA-approved test, based on the results of the KEYNOTE-181 and KEYNOTE-180 trials. 

In June 2019, the FDA approved Keytruda as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial. Keytruda was initially approved for HNSCC under the FDA's accelerated approval process based on data from the Phase 1b KEYNOTE-012 trial. In accordance with the accelerated approval process, continued approval was contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit, which has now been demonstrated in KEYNOTE-048 and has resulted in the FDA converting the accelerated approval to a full (regular) approval. Keytruda was approved for these indications by the EC in November 2019 and by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in December 2019. 

Also in June 2019, the FDA approved Keytruda as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic SCLC based on pooled data from the KEYNOTE-158 (cohort G) and KEYNOTE-028 (cohort C1) clinical trials. 

In April 2019, the FDA approved Keytruda in combination with Inlyta (axitinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer, based on findings from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 trial. Keytruda was approved for this indication by the EC in September 2019 and by Japan's MHLW in December 2019. 

Also in April 2019, the FDA approved an expanded label for Keytruda as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] &#8805;1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, in stage III disease where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, and in metastatic disease. The approval was based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial. 

In September 2019, the FDA approved the combination of Keytruda plus Lenvima for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient. 

In March 2019, the EC approved Keytruda in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic squamous NSCLC based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial. Keytruda was approved for this indication by the FDA in October 2018. 

In April 2019, the EC approved a new extended dosing schedule of 400 mg every six weeks (Q6W) delivered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes for all approved monotherapy indications in the EU. The Q6W dose is available in addition to the formerly approved dose of Keytruda 200 mg every three weeks (Q3W) infused over 30 minutes. 

Additionally, in 2019, Keytruda received the following approvals from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA): in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial; as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by a NMPA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, based on the results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial; and in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC based on findings from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial. 

Global sales of Keytruda grew 55% in 2019 driven by higher demand as the Company continues to launch Keytruda with multiple new indications globally. Sales in the United States continue to build across the multiple approved indications, in particular for the treatment of NSCLC as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for both nonsquamous and squamous metastatic NSCLC, along with uptake in the recently launched RCC and adjuvant melanoma indications. Other indications contributing to U.S. sales growth include HNSCC, urothelial carcinoma, melanoma, and MSI-H cancer. Keytruda sales growth in international markets was driven primarily by performance in Europe, Japan and China reflecting increased use in the treatment of NSCLC, as well as for the more recently approved indications as described above. 

The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Keytruda . Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of Keytruda through 2023 to one third party; this royalty will decline to 2.5% for 2024 through 2026 and will terminate thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party, the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty will expire in the United States in 2024 and in major European markets in 2025. The royalties are included in Cost of sales . 

Pursuant to a re-pricing rule, the Japanese government reduced the price of Keytruda by 17.5% effective February 2020. Additionally, Keytruda will be subject to another significant price reduction in April 2020 under a provision of the Japanese pricing rules. 

Lynparza, an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca entered into in July 2017 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers. The increase in alliance revenue related to Lynparza in 2019 was driven primarily by expanded use in the United States, the EU, Japan and China reflecting in part the ongoing launch of new indications. Lynparza received approval for the treatment of certain types of advanced ovarian cancer in the United States in December 2018, in the EU and in Japan in June 2019, and in China in December 2019 based on the results of the Phase 3 SOLO-1 trial. Also, in April 2019, the EC approved Lynparza for the treatment of certain adult patients with advanced breast cancer based on the results of the Phase 3 OlympiAD trial. Additionally, in December 2019, the FDA approved Lynparza for the maintenance treatment of certain adult patients with advanced pancreatic cancer based on the results of the Phase 3 POLO trial. 

Lenvima, an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai entered into in March 2018 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, HCC, and in combination with evorolimus for certain patients with RCC. Additionally, in September 2019, the FDA approved the combination of Keytruda plus Lenvima for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient. This marks the first U.S. approval for the combination of Keytruda plus Lenvima. The increase in alliance revenue related to Lenvima in 2019 reflects strong performance in the treatment of HCC following recent worldwide launches, as well as a full year of collaboration activity in 2019. 

Global sales of Emend , for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting, declined 26% in 2019 driven primarily by lower demand and pricing in the United States due to competition, including recent generic competition for Emend for Injection following U.S. patent expiry in September 2019. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Emend expired in 2015 and the patent that provided market exclusivity in most major European markets expired in May 2019. Additionally, Emend for Injection will lose market exclusivity in major European markets in August 2020. The Company anticipates that sales of Emend for Injection in these markets will decline significantly thereafter.

Worldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of HPV, grew 19% in 2019 driven primarily by higher demand in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in China, and higher demand in certain European markets reflecting increased vaccination rates for both boys and girls. Growth was partially offset by lower sales in the United States. The U.S. sales decline was driven by the borrowing of Gardasil 9 doses from the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, offset in part by higher demand and pricing. 

In 2019, the Company borrowed doses of Gardasil 9 from the CDC Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile. The borrowing reduced sales in 2019 by approximately $120 million and the Company recognized a corresponding liability. During 2018, the Company replenished doses borrowed from the CDC Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile in 2017 resulting in the recognition of sales of $125 million in 2018 and a reversal of the liability related to that borrowing. 

The decision of Japan's MHLW to suspend the active recommendation for HPV vaccination is still under review. 

The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9. Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a 7% royalty on worldwide sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 to one third party (this agreement expires in December 2023) and an additional 7% royalty on sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the United States to another third party (this agreement expires in December 2028). The royalties are included in Cost of sales . 

Global sales of ProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 27% in 2019 driven primarily by higher volumes and pricing in the United States, as well as volume growth in the EU largely reflecting a competitor supply issue. 

Worldwide sales of M-M-R II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 28% in 2019 driven primarily by higher sales in the United Sates reflecting increased demand due to measles outbreaks, as well as higher pricing. The Company anticipates that U.S. sales of M-M-R II will decline in 2020 driven by lower expected demand related to fewer measles outbreaks. 

Global sales of Varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), grew 25% in 2019 driven primarily by government tenders in Latin America, as well as higher pricing and volume growth in the United States. Varivax sales are expected to decline in 2020 due in part to the timing of government tenders and competition in select Latin American markets. 

Global sales of RotaTeq, a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, grew 9% in 2019 driven primarily by continued uptake from the launch in China and higher volumes in the United States, partially offset by lower volumes in Latin America. 

In December 2019, the FDA approved Ervebo for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years of age and older. As previously announced, Merck is working to initiate manufacturing of licensed doses and expects these doses to start becoming available in approximately the third quarter of 2020. Merck is working closely with the U.S. government, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) to plan for how eventual, licensed doses will support future public health preparedness and response efforts against Zaire ebolavirus disease. Merck is not seeking to profit from sales of this vaccine; rather, to ensure the vaccine is sustainable by recovering manufacturing and operational costs associated with the program. Ervebo was also granted a conditional marking authorization by the EC. Additionally, Merck has made submissions to African country national regulatory authorities in collaboration with the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum that will allow the vaccine to be registered in African countries considered to be at-risk for Ebola outbreaks by the WHO. In February 2020, Merck confirmed that four African countries have approved Ervebo . Approvals in additional countries in Africa are anticipated in the near future.

Global sales of Bridion , for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, grew 23% in 2019 driven by higher demand globally, particularly in the United States. 

Worldwide sales of Noxafil , for the prevention of invasive fungal infections, declined 11% in 2019 driven primarily by generic competition in the United States. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing a decline in U.S. Noxafil sales as a result of generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Additionally, the patent for Noxafil expired in a number of major European markets in December 2019. As a result, the Company anticipates sales of Noxafil in these markets will decline significantly in future periods. 

Global sales of Invanz , for the treatment of certain infections, declined 47% in 2019 driven by generic competition in the United States. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Invanz expired in November 2017 and generic competition began in the second half of 2018. The Company subsequently experienced a significant decline in Invanz sales in the United States as a result of this generic competition and has since lost most of its U.S. Invanz sales. 

Global sales of Cubicin , an I.V. antibiotic for complicated skin and skin structure infections or bacteremia when caused by designated susceptible organisms, declined 30% in 2019 resulting primarily from ongoing generic competition in the United States following expiration of the U.S. composition patent for Cubicin in 2016. 

In 2019, the FDA and EC approved expanded indications for Zerbaxa for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms based on the results of the pivotal Phase 3 ASPECT-NP trial. Zerbaxa was previously approved in the United States and EU for the treatment of adults with certain complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. 

In July 2019, the FDA approved Recarbrio for injection, a new combination antibacterial for the treatment of adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options with complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by certain susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms. Recarbrio was approved by the EC in February 2020. Merck anticipates making Recarbrio available in the first half of 2020. 

In January 2020, the FDA approved Dificid (fidaxomicin) for oral suspension and Dificid tablets for the treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium ) difficile -associated diarrhea in children aged six months and older.

Sales of Simponi , a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases (marketed by the Company in Europe, Russia and Turkey), declined 7% in 2019 driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange and lower pricing in Europe. Sales of Simponi are being unfavorably affected by the launch of biosimilars for a competing product. The Company expects this competition will continue to unfavorably affect sales of Simponi . 

Sales of Remicade, a treatment for inflammatory diseases (marketed by the Company in Europe, Russia and Turkey), declined 29% in 2019 driven by ongoing biosimilar competition in the Company's marketing territories. The Company lost market exclusivity for Remicade in major European markets in 2015 and no longer has market exclusivity in any of its marketing territories. The Company is experiencing pricing and volume declines in these markets as a result of biosimilar competition and expects the declines to continue.

Worldwide sales of Isentress/Isentress HD , an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, declined 15% in 2019 primarily reflecting lower demand in the United States and in the EU due to competitive pressure. 

In September 2019, the FDA approved supplemental New Drug Applications (NDA) for Pifeltro (doravirine) in combination with other antiretroviral agents, and for Delstrigo (doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) as a complete regimen, that expand their indications to include adult patients with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen.

Combined global sales of Zetia (marketed in most countries outside the United States as Ezetrol ) and Vytorin (marketed outside the United States as Inegy ), medicines for lowering LDL cholesterol, declined 35% in 2019 driven primarily by lower sales in the EU. The EU patents for Ezetrol and Inegy expired in April 2018 and April 2019, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets as a result of generic competition and expects the declines to continue. The sales decline was also attributable to loss of exclusivity in Australia. Merck lost market exclusivity in the United States for Zetia in 2016 and Vytorin in 2017 and subsequently lost nearly all U.S. sales of these products as a result of generic competition. 

Sales of Atozet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, grew 13% in 2019 , primarily driven by higher demand in the EU and in Korea. 

Sales of Rosuzet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, more than doubled in 2019 , primarily driven by the launch in Japan, as well as higher demand in Korea. 

Adempas, a cardiovascular drug for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is part of a worldwide clinical development collaboration with Bayer AG (Bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators including Adempas (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in alliance revenue of 27% in 2019 was driven both by higher profits from Bayer and higher sales of Adempas in Merck's marketing territories.

Worldwide combined sales of Januvia and Janumet , medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 7% in 2019 as a result of continued pricing pressure in the United States, partially offset by higher demand in most international markets. The Company expects U.S. pricing pressure to continue. The patents that provide market exclusivity for Januvia and Janumet in the United States expire in July 2022 (although six-month pediatric exclusivity may extend this date). The patent that provides market exclusivity for Januvia in the EU expires in July 2022 (although pediatric exclusivity may extend this date to September 2022). The supplementary patent certificate that provides market exclusivity for Janumet in the EU expires in April 2023. The Company anticipates sales of Januvia and Janumet in these markets will decline substantially after these patent expiries.

Biosimilar products are marketed by the Company pursuant to an agreement with Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Samsung) to develop and commercialize multiple pre-specified biosimilar candidates. Currently, the Company markets Renflexis (infliximab-abda), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab) for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases; Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb), a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ neu receptor antagonist biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2 overexpressing gastric cancer; and Brenzys (etanercept biosimilar), a TNF antagonist biosimilar to Enbrel for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. Merck's commercialization territories under the agreement vary by product. Sale growth of biosimilars in 2019 was driven by continued uptake of Renflexis in United States since launch in 2017, continued uptake of Ontruzant in the EU since launch in 2018, and the launch of Brenzys in Brazil in 2019.

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales was $14.1 billion in 2019 compared with $13.5 billion in 2018 . Cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions, which totaled $1.4 billion in 2019 compared with $2.7 billion in 2018. Cost of sales also includes the amortization of amounts capitalized in connection with collaborations of $464 million in 2019 compared with $347 million in 2018 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, costs in 2019 include intangible asset impairment charges of $705 million related to marketed products recorded in connection with business acquisitions (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to intangible assets that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business acquisitions and such charges could be material. Costs in 2018 include a $423 million charge related to the termination of a collaboration agreement with Samsung for insulin glargine (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities which amounted to $251 million in 2019 compared with $21 million in 2018 , primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed below. 

Gross margin was 69.9% in 2019 compared with 68.1% in 2018 . The gross margin improvement in 2019 reflects the charge recorded in 2018 in connection with the termination of the collaboration agreement with Samsung (noted above), favorable product mix, and lower amortization of intangible assets (noted above). These improvements in gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances, inventory write-offs, pricing pressure, and higher restructuring costs. 

Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10.6 billion in 2019 , an increase of 5% compared with 2018 , driven primarily by higher administrative costs, acquisition and divestiture-related costs (largely related to the acquisition of Antelliq), promotional expenses primarily in support of strategic brands, and restructuring costs, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower selling costs. SG&A expenses in 2019 include restructuring costs of $34 million related primarily to accelerated depreciation for facilities to be closed or divested. Separation costs associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed below. SG&A expenses include acquisition and divestiture-related costs of $126 million in 2019 compared 

with $32 million in 2018, consisting of integration, transaction, and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. 

Research and Development 

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $9.9 billion in 2019 , an increase of 1% compared with 2018 . The increase was driven primarily by a $993 million charge in 2019 for the acquisition of Peloton (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. The increase in R&D expenses in 2019 was partially offset by a $1.4 billion charge in 2018 related to the formation of an oncology collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a $344 million charge in 2018 related to the acquisition of Viralytics Limited (Viralytics) (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. 

R&D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $6.1 billion in 2019 compared with $5.6 billion in 2018. Also included in R&D expenses are Animal Health research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $2.6 billion in 2019 and $2.3 billion in 2018. R&D expenses also include in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charges of $172 million and $152 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business acquisitions and such charges could be material. In addition, R&D expenses include expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with business acquisitions. During 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a net reduction in expenses of $39 million and $54 million, respectively, related to changes in these estimates. 

Restructuring Costs 

In early 2019, Merck approved a new global restructuring program (Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on further optimizing the Company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant rationalization, builds on prior restructuring programs and does not include any actions associated with the planned spin-off of NewCo. As the Company continues to evaluate its global footprint and overall operating model, it has subsequently identified additional actions under the Restructuring Program, and could identify further actions over time. The actions currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program now estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion . The Company expects to record charges of approximately $800 million in 2020 related to the Restructuring Program. The Company anticipates the actions under the Restructuring Program to result in annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of 2023. Actions under previous global restructuring programs have been substantially completed. 

Restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with these restructuring activities, were $638 million in 2019 and $632 million in 2018 . Separation costs incurred were associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Also included in restructuring costs are asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. For segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. 

Additional costs associated with the Company's restructuring activities are included in Cost of sales , Selling, general and administrative and Research and development . The Company recorded aggregate pretax costs of $927 million in 2019 and $658 million in 2018 related to restructuring program activities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).

##TABLE_END

Pharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, as well as SG&A expenses directly incurred by the segment. Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&A and R&D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, research and development expenses incurred by MRL, or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, intangible asset impairment charges and changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in "Other" in the above table. Also included in "Other" are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales. During 2019, as a result of changes to the Company's internal reporting structure, certain costs that were previously included in the Pharmaceutical segment are now being included as part of non-segment expenses within MRL. Prior period Pharmaceutical segment profits have been recast to reflect these changes on a comparable basis. 

Pharmaceutical segment profits grew 14% in 2019 compared with 2018 driven primarily by higher sales, as well as lower selling costs. Animal Health segment profits declined 3% in 2019 driven primarily by unfavorable product mix, higher investments in selling and product development, and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher sales. 

Taxes on Income 

The effective income tax rates of 14.7% in 2019 and 28.8% in 2018 reflect the impacts of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and the beneficial impact of foreign earnings, including product mix. The effective income tax rate in 2019 also reflects the favorable impact of a $364 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of Merck's Consumer Care (MCC) business due to the lapse in the statute of limitations. In addition, the effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the unfavorable impacts of a charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and charges of $117 million related to the finalization of treasury regulations for the transition tax associated with the 2017 enactment of U.S. tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The effective income tax rate in 2018 includes measurement-period adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 associated with the enactment of the TCJA, including $124 million related to the transition tax. In addition, the effective income tax rate for 2018 reflects the unfavorable impacts of a charge recorded in connection with the formation of a collaboration with Eisai and a charge related to the termination of a collaboration agreement with Samsung for which no tax benefit was recognized. 

Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 

Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $(66) million in 2019 compared with $(27) million in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 were driven primarily by the portion of goodwill impairment charges related to certain business in the Healthcare Services segment that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

Net Income and Earnings per Common Share 

Net income attributable to Merck & Co., Inc. was $9.8 billion in 2019 and $6.2 billion in 2018 . EPS was $3.81 in 2019 and $2.32 in 2018 . 

Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS 

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company's performance that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. 

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP EPS. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP pretax income. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. The information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and EPS prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). 

A reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:

The estimated tax impact on the excluded items is determined by applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments. 

##TABLE_END (2) Amount in 2017 was provisional (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Costs 

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with business acquisitions and divestitures. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset impairment charges and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also excluded are integration, transaction, and certain other costs associated with business acquisitions and divestitures. 

Restructuring Costs 

Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). These amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site 

will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. Restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs. 

Certain Other Items 

These items are adjusted for after they are evaluated on an individual basis considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. Typically, these consist of items that are unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS in 2019 is a charge for the acquisition of Peloton (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), tax charges related to the finalization of U.S. treasury regulations related to the TCJA, a net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, and a tax benefit related to the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of MCC (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS in 2018 is a charge related to the formation of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a charge related to the termination of a collaboration agreement with Samsung for insulin glargine (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), a charge for the acquisition of Viralytics (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), and measurement-period adjustments related to the provisional amounts recorded for the TCJA (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS in 2017 is a charge related to the formation of a collaboration with AstraZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as a provisional net tax charge related to the enactment of the TCJA, a net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters and a tax benefit related to the settlement of a state income tax matter (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Research and Development 

A chart reflecting the Company's current research pipeline as of February 21, 2020 is set forth in Item 1. "Business  Research and Development" above. 

Research and Development Update 

The Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the United States and internationally. 

Keytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the treatment of many cancers that is in clinical development for expanded indications. These approvals were the result of a broad clinical development program that currently consists of more than 1,000 clinical trials, including more than 600 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. These studies encompass more than 30 cancer types including: biliary tract, cervical, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, hepatocellular, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, nasopharyngeal, non-small-cell lung, ovarian, PMBCL, prostate, renal, small-cell lung, triple-negative breast and urothelial, many of which are currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Further trials are being planned for other cancers. 

Keytruda is under review in the EU as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic NSCLC, and whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS &#8805;1%) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial. 

Keytruda is under review in Japan as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-062 trial. 

Keytruda is also under review in Japan as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal or esophagogastric junction carcinoma based on the results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-181 trial. Merck has made the decision to withdraw its Type II variation application for Keytruda for this indication in the EU. 

In October 2019, the FDA accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) seeking use of Keytruda for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that 

is not curable by surgery or radiation based on the results of the KEYNOTE-629 trial. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of June 29, 2020. 

In February 2020, Merck announced the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding Merck's supplemental BLAs seeking to update the dosing frequency for Keytruda to include a 400 mg dose infused over 30 minutes every-six-weeks (Q6W) option in multiple indications. The submitted applications are based on pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation data presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. These data supported the EC approval of 400 mg Q6W dosing for Keytruda monotherapy indications in March 2019. Merck is reviewing the letter and will discuss next steps with the FDA. 

Additionally, Keytruda has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in combination with enfortumab vedotin, in the first-line setting for the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. 

In September 2019, Merck announced results from the pivotal neoadjuvant/adjuvant Phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial in patients with early-stage TNBC. The trial investigated a regimen of neoadjuvant Keytruda plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant Keytruda as monotherapy (the Keytruda regimen) compared with a regimen of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo (the chemotherapy-placebo regimen). Interim findings were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 Congress. In the neoadjuvant phase, Keytruda plus chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant increase in pathological complete response (pCR) versus chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC. The improvement seen when adding Keytruda to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression. In the other dual primary endpoint of event-free-survival (EFS), with a median follow-up of 15.5 months, the Keytruda regimen reduced the risk of progression in the neoadjuvant phase and recurrence in the adjuvant phase compared with the chemotherapy-placebo regimen. Merck continues to discuss interim analysis data from KEYNOTE-522 with regulatory authorities. The Keytruda breast cancer clinical development program encompasses several internal and external collaborative studies. 

In February 2020, Merck announced that the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 trial investigating Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS &#8805;10). Based on an interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), first-line treatment with Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel or gemcitabine/carboplatin) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy alone in these patients. Based on the recommendation of the DMC, the trial will continue without changes to evaluate the other dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). 

In May 2019, Merck announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-119 trial evaluating Keytruda as monotherapy for the second- or third-line treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint of superior OS compared to chemotherapy. Other endpoints were not formally tested per the study protocol because the primary endpoint of OS was not met. 

In June 2019, Merck announced full results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-062 trial evaluating Keytruda as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In the monotherapy arm of the study, Keytruda met a primary endpoint by demonstrating noninferiority to chemotherapy, the current standard of care, for OS in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS &#8805;1). In the combination arm of KEYNOTE-062, Keytruda plus chemotherapy was not found to be statistically superior for OS (CPS &#8805;1 or CPS &#8805;10) or PFS (CPS &#8805;1) compared with chemotherapy alone. Results were presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting. In September 2017, the FDA approved Keytruda as a third-line treatment for previously treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS &#8805;1) as determined by an FDA-approved test. KEYNOTE-062 was a potential confirmatory trial for this accelerated, third-line approval. In addition to KEYNOTE-062, additional first-line, Phase 

3 studies in Merck's gastric clinical program include KEYNOTE-811 and KEYNOTE-859, as well as KEYNOTE-585 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment setting. 

In January 2020, Merck announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-604 trial investigating Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy met one of its dual primary endpoints of PFS in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage SCLC. At the final analysis of the study, there was also an improvement in OS for patients treated with Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone; however, these OS results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with regulatory authorities. 

Lynparza is an oral PARP inhibitor currently approved for certain types of advanced ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers being co-developed for multiple cancer types as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Lynparza is under review in the EU as a first-line maintenance monotherapy for patients with g BRCA m metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease has not progressed following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Lynparza was approved for this indication by the FDA in December 2019 based on results from the Phase 3 POLO trial. A decision from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected in the second half of 2020. 

In January 2020, the FDA accepted a supplemental NDA for Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer whose disease showed a complete or partial response to first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab based on the results from the pivotal Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial. A PDUFA date is set for the second quarter of 2020. This indication is also under review in the EU. 

In January 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review a supplemental NDA for Lynparza for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations, who have progressed following prior treatment with a new hormonal agent based on positive results from the Phase 3 PROfound trial. A PDUFA date is set for the second quarter of 2020. This indication is also under review in the EU. 

In June 2019, Merck and AstraZeneca presented full results from the Phase 3 SOLO-3 trial which evaluated Lynparza, compared to chemotherapy, for the treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed patients with g BRCA m advanced ovarian cancer, who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The results from the trial showed a statistically-significant and clinically-meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR) in the Lynparza arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. The key secondary endpoint of PFS was also significantly increased in the Lynparza arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. The results were presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting. 

MK-5618, selumetinib, is a MEK 1/2 inhibitor being co-developed as part of a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Selumetinib is under Priority Review with the FDA as a potential new medicine for pediatric patients aged three years and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. This regulatory submission was based on positive results from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored SPRINT Phase 2 Stratum 1 trial. A PDUFA date is set for the second quarter of 2020. 

V503 is under review in Japan for an initial indication in females for the prevention of certain HPV-related diseases and precursors. 

In February 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review a supplemental BLA for Gardasil 9 for the prevention of certain head and neck cancers caused by vaccine-type HPV in females and males 9 through 45 years of age. The FDA set a PDUFA date of June 2020. 

In addition to the candidates under regulatory review, the Company has several drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical development in addition to the Keytruda programs discussed above. 

Lynparza, in addition to the indications under review discussed above, is in Phase 3 development in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of NSCLC. 

Lenvima is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for certain types of thyroid cancer, HCC, and in combination for certain patients with RCC being co-developed as part of a strategic collaboration with Eisai (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Pursuant to the agreement, the companies will jointly 

initiate clinical studies evaluating the Keytruda /Lenvima combination in six types of cancer (endometrial cancer, NSCLC, HCC, HNSCC, bladder cancer and melanoma), as well as a basket trial targeting multiple cancer types. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Keytruda in combination with Lenvima both for the potential treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic RCC and for the potential treatment of patients with unresectable HCC not amenable to locoregional treatment. 

MK-7264, gefapixant, is a selective, non-narcotic, orally-administered P2X3-receptor antagonist being investigated in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of refractory, chronic cough and in a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of women with endometriosis-related pain. 

MK-1242, vericiguat, is a sGC stimulator for the potential treatment of patients with worsening chronic heart failure being developed as part of a worldwide strategic collaboration between Merck and Bayer (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Vericiguat is being studied in patients suffering from chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (Phase 3 clinical trial) and from chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (Phase 2 clinical trial). In November 2019, Merck announced that the Phase 3 VICTORIA study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vericiguat met the primary efficacy endpoint. Vericiguat reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death in patients with worsening chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction compared to placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies. The results of the VICTORIA study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in 2020. 

V114 is an investigational polyvalent conjugate vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. In June 2018, Merck initiated the first Phase 3 study in the adult population for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. Currently six Phase 3 adult studies are ongoing, including studies in healthy adults 50 years of age or older, adults with risk factors for pneumococcal disease, those infected with HIV, and those who are recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In October 2018, Merck began the first Phase 3 study in the pediatric population. Currently, eight studies are ongoing, including studies in healthy infants and in children afflicted with sickle cell disease. V114 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes in pediatric patients (6 weeks to 18 years of age) and in adults. 

The Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company's research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company's research and development resources on candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company is committed to ensuring that externally sourced programs remain an important component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies. 

The Company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, pain, respiratory diseases, and vaccines. 

Acquired In-Process Research and Development 

In connection with business acquisitions, the Company has recorded the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2019 , the balance of IPR&D was $1.0 billion . 

The IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if certain of the IPR&D programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as IPR&D as of the acquisition date. If such 

circumstances were to occur, the Company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges and such charges could be material. 

In 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 the Company recorded IPR&D impairment charges within Research and development expenses of $172 million , $152 million and $483 million , respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Additional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approval. 

Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and License Agreements 

Merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. Certain recent transactions are described below. Merck is actively monitoring the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company's strategic criteria. 

In April 2019, Merck acquired Immune Design, a late-stage immunotherapy company employing next-generation in vivo approaches to enable the body's immune system to fight disease, for $301 million in cash. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business. Merck recognized intangible assets for IPR&D of $156 million , cash of $83 million and other net assets of $42 million . The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired of $20 million was recorded as goodwill that was allocated to the Pharmaceutical segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D were determined using an income approach. Actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed. 

In July 2019, Merck acquired Peloton, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel small molecule therapeutic candidates targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-2&#945; (HIF-2&#945;) for the treatment of patients with cancer and other non-oncology diseases. Peloton's lead candidate, MK-6482 (formerly PT2977), is a novel oral HIF-2&#945; inhibitor in late-stage development for renal cell carcinoma. Merck made an upfront payment of $1.2 billion in cash; additionally, former Peloton shareholders will be eligible to receive $50 million upon U.S. regulatory approval, $50 million upon first commercial sale in the United States, and up to $1.05 billion of sales-based milestones. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded cash of $157 million , deferred tax liabilities of $52 million , and other net liabilities of $4 million at the acquisition date and Research and development expenses of $993 million in 2019 related to the transaction. 

In January 2020, Merck acquired ArQule, Inc. (ArQule), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company focused on kinase inhibitor discovery and development for the treatment of patients with cancer and other diseases for $2.7 billion . ArQule's lead investigational candidate, MK-1026 (formerly ARQ 531), is a novel, oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor currently in a Phase 2 dose expansion study for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The Company is in the process of determining the preliminary fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and total consideration transferred in this transaction, which will be accounted for as an acquisition of a business. 

Capital Expenditures 

Capital expenditures were $3.5 billion in 2019 , $2.6 billion in 2018 and $1.9 billion in 2017 . Expenditures in the United States were $1.9 billion in 2019 , $1.5 billion in 2018 and $1.2 billion in 2017 . The increased capital expenditures in 2019 reflect investment in new capital projects focused primarily on increasing manufacturing capacity for Merck's key products. As previously announced, the Company plans to invest more than $19 billion in new capital projects from 2019-2023. 

Depreciation expense was $1.7 billion in 2019 , $1.4 billion in 2018 and $1.5 billion in 2017 , of which $1.2 billion in 2019 , $1.0 billion in 2018 and $1.0 billion in 2017 , related to locations in the United States. Total depreciation expense in 2019 and 2017 included accelerated depreciation of $233 million and $60 million , respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Merck's strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.

Cash provided by operating activities was $13.4 billion in 2019 compared with $10.9 billion in 2018 , reflecting stronger operating performance and increased accounts receivable factoring as discussed below. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders. 

Cash used in investing activities was $2.6 billion in 2019 compared with cash provided by investing activities of $4.3 billion in 2018 . The change was driven primarily by lower proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments, the acquisitions of Antelliq and Peloton in 2019, and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower purchases of securities and other investments. 

Cash used in financing activities was $8.9 billion in 2019 compared with $13.2 billion in 2018 . The lower use of cash in financing activities was driven primarily by proceeds from the issuance of debt and lower purchases of treasury stock reflecting the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program in 2018 as discussed below, as well as lower payments on debt, partially offset by the repayment of short-term borrowings, higher dividends paid to shareholders and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 

The Company has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company factored $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion of accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively, under these factoring arrangements, which reduced outstanding accounts receivable. The cash received from the financial institutions is reported within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In certain of these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial institutions. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had collected $256 million on behalf of the financial institutions, which was remitted to them in January 2020. The net cash flows from these collections are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

The Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:

Includes future inventory purchases the Company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties of $1.5 billion , including $49 million reflected as a current liability. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond 2020 cannot be made. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  

In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the Company has elected to pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the TCJA (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  

Reflects payments under collaborative agreements for sales-based milestones that were achieved in 2019 (and therefore deemed to be contractual obligations) but not paid until January 2020 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 

##TABLE_END (5) Amounts exclude reasonably certain lease renewals that have not yet been executed (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Amounts do not include contingent milestone payments related to collaborative arrangements or acquisitions as they are not considered contractual obligations until the successful achievement of developmental, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. At December 31, 2019 , the Company has recognized liabilities for contingent sales-based milestone payments related to collaborations with AstraZeneca, Eisai and Bayer where payment remains subject to the achievement of the related sales milestone aggregating $1.4 billion (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Excluded from research and development obligations are potential future funding commitments of up to approximately $60 million for investments in research venture capital funds. Loans payable and current portion of long-term debt reflects $226 million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. Required funding obligations for 2020 relating to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. However, the Company currently anticipates contributing approximately $100 million to its U.S. pension plans, $150 million to its international pension plans and $15 million to its other postretirement benefit plans during 2020 . 

In March 2019, the Company issued $5.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million of 2.90% notes due 2024, $1.75 billion of 3.40% notes due 2029, $1.0 billion of 3.90% notes due 2039, and $1.5 billion of 4.00% notes due 2049. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of $5.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 

In December 2018, the Company exercised a make-whole provision on its $1.25 billion, 5.00% notes due 2019 and repaid this debt. 

In November 2017, the Company launched tender offers for certain outstanding notes and debentures. The Company paid $810 million in aggregate consideration (applicable purchase price together with accrued interest) to redeem $585 million principal amount of debt that was validly tendered in connection with the tender offers. 

The Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in June 2024. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility. 

In March 2018, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the automatic shelf registration process available to "well-known seasoned issuers" which is effective for three years. 

Effective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date. 

The Company continues to maintain a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations. 

In November 2019, Merck's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock that was paid in January 2020. In January 2020 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share on the Company's common stock for the second quarter of 2020 payable in April 2020 . 

In October 2018, Merck's Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to $10 billion of Merck's common stock for its treasury. The treasury stock purchase authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market transactions, block transactions, on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company spent $4.8 billion to purchase 59 million shares of its common stock for its treasury during 2019 . In addition, the Company received 7.7 million shares in settlement of ASR agreements as discussed below. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's remaining share repurchase authorization was $7.2 billion . The Company purchased $9.1 billion and $4.0 billion of its common stock during 2018 and 2017 , respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. 

On October 25, 2018, the Company entered into ASR agreements with two third-party financial institutions (Dealers). Under the ASR agreements, Merck agreed to purchase $5 billion of Merck's common stock, in total, with an initial delivery of 56.7 million shares of Merck's common stock, based on the then-current market price, made by the Dealers to Merck, and payments of $5 billion made by Merck to the Dealers on October 29, 2018, which were funded with existing cash and investments, as well as short-term borrowings. Upon settlement of the ASR agreements in April 2019, Merck received an additional 7.7 million shares as determined by the average daily volume weighted-average price of Merck's common stock during the term of the ASR program, less a negotiated discount, bringing the total shares received by Merck under this program to 64.4 million . 

Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures 

The Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments. 

A significant portion of the Company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below. 

Foreign Currency Risk Management 

The Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates. 

The objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options. 

Because Merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $456 million and $441 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

The Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. For exposures in developing country currencies, the Company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

A sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against 

all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , Income before taxes would have declined by approximately $110 million and $134 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Because the Company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

The economy of Argentina was determined to be hyperinflationary in 2018; consequently, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company began remeasuring its monetary assets and liabilities for those operations in earnings. The impact to the Company's results was immaterial. 

The Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( OCI ), and remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI) until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded component). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in OCI . The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded component on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. The Company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI . 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

The Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk. 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company was a party to 19 pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.

The interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

The Company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of 

Merck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2019 and 2018 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2019 and 2018 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The fair value of Merck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities, primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration, as well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions 

To determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. 

In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company's intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. Certain of the Company's business acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is 

remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment. 

The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations. 

The fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. The Company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate. 

The fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. 

If the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date. In these instances, product development milestones are recognized upon achievement and sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved. 

Revenue Recognition 

Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company's contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation. 

The vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. For businesses within the Company's Healthcare Services segment and certain services in the Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material. 

The nature of the Company's business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. 

In the United States, sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year. 

The U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges 

the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. 

The Company continually monitors its provision for aggregate customer discounts. There were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate customer discount provision in 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . 

Summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to U.S. sales is as follows:

Accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in Accounts receivable and Accrued and other current liabilities were $233 million and $2.2 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2019 and were $245 million and $2.4 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2018 . 

Outside of the United States, variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the Company's specific payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale. 

The Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns provision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net pharmaceutical sales was 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2017. Outside of the United States, returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis. 

Merck's payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products, including Keytruda , have longer payment terms up to 90 days. Outside of the United States, payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms. 

Through its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing 

product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns. 

Wholesalers generally provide only the above-mentioned data to the Company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. Given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the Company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns. 

Inventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches 

The Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. The Company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the Company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $168 million and $7 million , respectively. 

Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities 

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. 

Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of approximately $240 million and $245 million , respectively, represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined. 

The Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where 

assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually. 

The Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $19 million in 2019 and are estimated at $47 million in the aggregate for the years 2020 through 2024 . In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $67 million and $71 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $58 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year. 

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. Total pretax share-based compensation expense was $417 million in 2019 , $348 million in 2018 and $312 million in 2017 . At December 31, 2019 , there was $603 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses. 

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 

Net periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $137 million in 2019 , $195 million in 2018 and $201 million in 2017 . Net periodic benefit (credit) for other postretirement benefit plans was $(49) million in 2019 , $(45) million in 2018 and $(60) million in 2017 . Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are largely attributable to changes in the discount rate affecting net loss amortization. 

The Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. The discount rates for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 3.20% to 3.50% at December 31, 2019 , compared with a range of 4.00% to 4.40% at December 31, 2018 . 

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the Company's plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2020 , the expected rate of return for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will range from 7.00% to 7.30% , compared to a range of 7.70% to 8.10% in 2019 . The decrease reflects lower expected asset returns and a modest shift in asset allocation. 

The Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company's U.S. pension and other 

postretirement benefit plans is allocated 30% to 45% in U.S. equities, 15% to 30% in international equities, 35% to 45% in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% in cash and other investments. The portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans' benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 10% , reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines. 

Actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $70 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the Company's net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $50 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on Merck's net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . Required funding obligations for 2020 relating to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the Company's funding requirements. 

Net loss amounts, which reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of AOCI . Expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Company's expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Also, net loss amounts in AOCI in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. 

Restructuring Costs 

Restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to streamline the Company's cost structure. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. When accruing termination costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and other related costs are reflected within Restructuring costs . Asset-related charges are reflected within Cost of sales , Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset. 

Impairments of Long-Lived Assets 

The Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. 

The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach. 

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company's share price. If the Company concludes it is more 

likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). 

Other acquired intangible assets (excluding IPR&D) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. 

IPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with the acquisition of a business represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the Company will combine IPR&D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results. 

The judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the Company's results of operations. 

Impairments of Investments 

The Company reviews its investments in marketable debt securities for impairments based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The Company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments in marketable debt securities, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost. Changes in fair value that are considered temporary are reported net of tax in OCI . An other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the marketable debt security. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings, recorded in Other (income) expense, net , is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. The remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI . 

Investments in publicly traded equity securities are reported at fair value determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Changes in fair value are included in Other (income) expense, net . Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost, plus or minus subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments, minus impairments. Such adjustments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net . Realized gains and losses for equity securities are included in Other (income) expense, net . 

Taxes on Income 

The Company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company's quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely 

of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). 

Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results 

This report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company's growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. 

The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K. In Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.
