Coronavirus. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office and will continue to have most of our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. 

Revenues in the latter half of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions as a result of COVID-19, although we are exiting the year with improved results and most countries had stable to positive year-over-year domestic spending growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Cross-border volume however, remained depressed, led by travel spending, as the majority of borders remain closed. While we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel, lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.

Highlights for fiscal 2020 . Net revenues for fiscal 2020 were $21.8 billion, a decrease of 5% over the prior year, primarily due to the year-over-year changes payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2020, partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point. 

Total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were $7.8 billion on a GAAP basis, and decreased 3% over the prior year, driven by lower litigation provision and our overall cost reduction strategy, offset by higher personnel and depreciation and amortization from our ongoing investments in support of our strategy for future growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were $7.7 billion on a non-GAAP basis, and increased 1% over the prior year primarily driven by higher personnel, offset by our overall cost reduction strategy. 

Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. 

 Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. 

 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. 

 Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. 

 Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and $600 million, respectively, and related tax benefits of $83 million and $137 million, respectively, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

 Charitable contributions . During fiscal 2018, we donated investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income decreased by $49 million. 

 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2020, in connection with the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020, we 

Table of Content s 

remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

 Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimate of approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

 Resolution of a tax item. During fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12 years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. The resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate. 

Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Release of preferred stock. In September 2020, we released $7.3 billion of the as-converted value from our series B and C preferred stock (alternatively referred to as UK&I and Europe preferred stock, respectively) and issued 374,819 shares of series A preferred stock in connection with the first mandatory release assessment, as required by the litigation management deed entered into at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 15Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Common stock repurchases. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program (the "January 2020 Program"). During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.1 billion. As of September 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.5 billion for share repurchase. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Senior notes. In fiscal 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in public offerings in an aggregate principal amount of $7.3 billion with maturities ranging between 7 and 30 years. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. 

On November 5, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Visa from acquiring Plaid, alleging that the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and would constitute monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Visa intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. See Note 2Acquisitions and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. 

Nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 4% and 10%, respectively. The decrease in nominal international payments volume of 1% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 (1) was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 2% and 9%, respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.

Financial Information Presentation 

Net Revenues 

Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees. 

The following sets forth the components of our net revenues: 

Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter's pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volumes are transacted. 

Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. 

International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer, or financial institution originating the transaction, is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed. 

Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. 

Client incentives consist of incentives provided in contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to grow payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. 

Operating Expenses 

Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. 

Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. 

Table of Content s 

Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. 

Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. 

General and administrative expenses consist mainly of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, indirect taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. 

Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss. 

Non-operating Income (Expense) 

Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expenses.

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 

Net revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in the latter part of March 2020. 

Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.  

 Service revenues increased primarily due to 1% growth in nominal payments volume. 

 Data processing revenues increased due to 2% growth in processed transactions, growth in value added services and select pricing modifications. 

 International transaction revenues decreased due to a 23% decline in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. International transaction revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications. 

 Other revenues increased primarily due to the increase in consulting and marketing services related fees, other value added services and acquisition-related revenues. 

 Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2020 partially offset by the recent decline in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

 Marketing expenses decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy, the absence of FIFA women's world cup and the delay of the Tokyo Olympics to fiscal 2021, partially offset by an increase in client marketing spend. 

 Professional fees decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. 

 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. 

 General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to travel restrictions and our overall cost reduction strategy. 

 Litigation provision decreased primarily due to lower accruals for uncovered litigation in fiscal 2020 and a $370 million accrual in fiscal 2019 related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 

 Interest expense, net decreased primarily as a result of derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt, offset by additional interest expense related to the issuance of debt in fiscal 2020. See Note 10Debt and Note 13Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

 Investment income and other decreased primarily due to lower gains on our equity investments and lower interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Effective Income Tax Rate 

The following table sets forth our effective income tax rate:

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 mainly due to a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense relating to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as a result of the enactment of UK legislation on July 22, 2020 that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. The remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities was primarily related to deferred taxes on intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Management of Our Liquidity 

We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. 

The objectives of our treasury policies are to: 

 provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; 

 ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; 

 ensure payments on required litigation settlements; 

 make planned capital investments in our business; 

 pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and 

 invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. 

Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. 

Cash Flow Data 

The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 

##TABLE_START For the Years Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2018  (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 10,440  $ 12,784 $ 12,941 Investing activities 1,427  (591) (3,084) Financing activities (3,968) (12,061) (10,790) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 440  (277) (101) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 

$ 8,339  $ (145) $ (1,034) ##TABLE_END

Operating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower net income, higher client incentive payments and timing of settlement. 

Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with fewer investment security purchases, lower purchase consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, due to fewer acquisitions and lower purchases of other investments. 

Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes, the absence of the deferred purchase consideration payment made in the prior year and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid. See Note 10Debt and Note 15Stockholders' Equity , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Table of Content s 

Sources of Liquidity 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 

Available-for-sale debt securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.6 billion, are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. 

Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. 

Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2020. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Credit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") which expires on July 25, 2024. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2020. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Senior notes. In fiscal 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in public offerings in an aggregate principal amount of $7.3 billion with maturities between 7 and 30 years. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The balance in this account at September 30, 2020, was $0.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this repor t. 

Credit Ratings 

At September 30, 2020, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor's and Moody's were as follows: 

##TABLE_START  Standard and Poor's Moody's Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1+ Stable P-1 Stable Long-term unsecured debt AA- Stable Aa3 Stable ##TABLE_END

Table of Content s 

Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 

Uses of Liquidity 

Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2020, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $452 million. We hold approximately $7.7 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2020, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. 

U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement relating to claims by the Damages Class, which was subsequently appealed. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. 

During fiscal 2020, we have reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. At September 30, 2020, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $0.9 billion for settlement with opt-out merchants. 

Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, could give rise to future liquidity needs. 

Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.1 billion. As of September 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.5 billion. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Dividends . During fiscal 2020, we declared and paid $2.7 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.30 per share. On October 23, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $703 million in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2020. See Note 15Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. 

Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2020, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million and to our Visa Europe's UK pension plans of $22 million. In fiscal 2021, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding 

Table of Content s 

our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe's UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 11Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased slightly during fiscal 2020. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. 

Senior notes. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Acquisitions. In fiscal 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. On November 5, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Visa from acquiring Plaid. See Note 2Acquisitions and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. 

Indemnifications 

We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement.

Contractual Obligations 

Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2020. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

(1) Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 10Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

(2) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. 

(3) Includes operating leases for premises and equipment, which range in original lease terms from less than one year to twenty-six years. 

(4) Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 19Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

(5) Includes expected dividend amount of $703 million as dividends were declared on October 23, 2020 and will be paid on December 1, 2020 to all holders of record of Visa's common and preferred stock as of November 13, 2020. 

(6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, we had also accrued $233 million of interest and $31 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. 

(7) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

(8) Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from less than one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets or marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2020, we have $4.4 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 

We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 

Table of Content s 

Revenue Recognition  Client Incentives 

Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 

Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. 

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2020, client incentives represented 23% of gross revenues. 

Legal and Regulatory Matters 

Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements. 

Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on management's understanding of the litigation profile, the specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. 

We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 

Income Taxes 

Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. 

Table of Content s 

Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. 

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.
