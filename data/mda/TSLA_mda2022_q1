 ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

Our mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. 

In 2022, we have produced 305,407 vehicles and delivered 310,048 vehicles through the first quarter, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles and expanding our global infrastructure. 

In 2022, we have deployed 846 MWh of energy storage products and 48 megawatts of solar energy systems through the first quarter. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized total revenues of $18.76 billion, representing a $8.37 billion increase compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $3.32 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.88 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. 

We ended the first quarter of 2022 with $18.01 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, representing an increase of $306 million from the end of 2021. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the three month period ended March 31, 2022 was $4.00 billion, representing an increase of $2.35 billion compared to $1.64 billion during the same period ended March 31, 2021. Capital expenditures amounted to $1.77 billion during the three month period ended March 31, 2022, compared to $1.35 billion during the same period ended March 31, 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, but we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods. 

Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2022 Outlook 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic 

&#160; 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply. We have also previously been, and are being, affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments, and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. 

&#160; 

In addition, we have experienced and are experiencing varying levels of inflation resulting in part from various supply chain disruptions, increased shipping and transportation costs, increased raw material and labor costs and other disruptions caused by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and general global economic conditions. The inflationary impact on our cost structure has contributed to adjustments in our product pricing, despite a continued focus on reducing our manufacturing costs where possible. 

&#160; 

Ultimately, we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or global economic trends. We will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing capacity at our current factories. Our current production continues to be affected by the industry-wide semiconductor and other component shortages, requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain. Production at Gigafactory Berlin started in March 2022 and we began Model Y deliveries from Gigafactory Texas in April 2022, which incorporated our 4680 in-house made cells. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories, we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability. 

However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, recent spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted in temporary shutdowns to Gigafactory Shanghai as well as parts of our supply chain. Moreover, we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory. 

Automotive&#8212;Demand and Sales 

Our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles&#8217; affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. In addition to ramping production in 2022, we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles&#8217; performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally, as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. 

However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade, environmental and political uncertainty, all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. 

Automotive&#8212;Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure 

&#160; 

As our deliveries increase, we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the recent production launch at Gigafactory Berlin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. 

&#160; 

Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment 

&#160; 

The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing cross-selling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. In the first quarter of 2022, however, such growth to our solar business was impeded by import delays on certain solar components. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 

Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends 

Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, including new iterations of our Megapack, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years. 

Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of &#8220;in-the-money&#8221; convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales. 

Operating Expense Trends 

As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally. 

In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, we recorded approximately $27 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. 

&#160; 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Automotive &#38; Services and Other Segment 

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting. 

Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. 

Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer. 

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, paid supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue. 

Automotive sales revenue increased $7.33 billion, or 89%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 111,915 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries, and an increase of 10,305 Model S and Model X cash deliveries year over year. This was achieved from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. There was also an increase in the average selling price of Model S and Model X compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. 

&#160; 

Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $161 million, or 31%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had a decrease in automotive regulatory credits revenue driven by lower sales of regulatory credits. 

Automotive leasing revenue increased $371 million, or 125%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue and an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program . 

Services and other revenue increased $386 million, or 43%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, retail merchandise revenue and insurance services revenue. 

Energy Generation and Storage Segment 

Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives. 

Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $122 million, or 25%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in deployments of Powerwall and Megapack. This was partially offset by a decrease in solar cash and loan deployments driven by constraints in importing certain components .

Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs of paid supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers. 

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $4.46 billion, or 69%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 111,915 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries, and an increase of 10,305 Model S and Model X cash deliveries year over year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in combined average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as Gigafactory Shanghai ramped in capacity, where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in China as well as decrease in combined average Model S and Model X costs per unit driven by lower average cost for the new versions of Model S and Model X from ramping up production. 

Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $248 million, or 155%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year and an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program. 

Cost of services and other revenue increased $324 million, or 34%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in costs to support our increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue, an increase in costs of retail merchandise and insurance services as our sales have increased and an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of non-Tesla used vehicles. 

Gross margin for total automotive increased from 26.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 to 32.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of Model Y as Gigafactory Shanghai ramped in capacity. The average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit have decreased due to localized procurement and manufacturing in China despite rising raw material, commodity, logistics and expedite costs. There was also an increase in overall Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a lower combined average cost per unit year over year, as well as an increase of $161 million in sales of regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them. 

Gross margin for total automotive &#38; services and other segment increased from 23.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 to 30.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a lower percentage of the segment during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. 

Energy Generation and Storage Segment 

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs. 

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by $93 million, or 16%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in deployments of Powerwall and Megapack, partially offset by a decrease in solar cash and loan costs as deployments have decreased and reductions in average costs per unit of Solar Roof. 

Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from -20.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 to -11.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to higher deployments of Powerwall which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an improvement in Solar Roof gross margin due to reductions in average costs per unit. These increases were partially offset by a decrease from lower solar cash and loan deployments.

Research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. 

R&#38;D expenses increased $199 million, or 30%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $90 million increase in facilities, outside services, freight and depreciation expense, a $75 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to an increase in headcount, an $18 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $13 million increase in R&#38;D expensed materials. These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, and there were additional R&#38;D expenses as we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin only closer to the end of the current quarter. 

R&#38;D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 6% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 to 5% in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our R&#38;D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product roadmap and technologies.

Selling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements. 

SG&#38;A expenses decreased $64 million, or 6%, in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This is primarily due to a decrease of $242 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $251 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. See Note 11, Equity Incentive Plans , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This was offset by an increase of $110 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and an increase of $68 million in office, information technology, facilities-related expenses, sales and marketing activities and other costs. 

SG&#38;A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 to 5% in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our SG&#38;A expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to operational efficiencies.

Other income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. 

Other income, net, changed favorably by $28 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and offset by a $10 million decrease in gain on our interest rate swaps which were settled in the current period.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by $64 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to a decrease in allocations to financing fund investors. 

&#160; 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. 

In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. 

Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following March 31, 2022, as well as in the long-term. 

See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs. 

Material Cash Requirements 

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. 

As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2022 Outlook&#8212;Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021 and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

As of March 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $3.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.17 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 10, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Sources and Conditions of Liquidity 

Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. 

As of March 31, 2022, we had $17.51 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $6.84 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollars. In addition, we had $2.36 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of March 31, 2022. Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets). For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 10, Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

&#160; 

We continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other marketable securities, digital assets and providing product related financing. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in digital assets. The fair market value of such digital assets held as of March 31, 2022 was $1.96 billion. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the times when we may want or need to liquidate them. Additionally, we held short-term marketable securities of $508 million as of March 31, 2022.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.35 billion to $4.00 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 from $1.64 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non-cash expenses and gains of $2.94 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $590 million. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 to support the ramp up in production at our factories and a larger increase in other non-current assets. The increase in our net operating assets and other liabilities was partially offset by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities . 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.77 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and $1.35 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, mainly for the construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin and the expansions of Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory. We also paid $386 million for purchases of marketable securities in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Additionally, net cash outflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets of $1.50 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of $272 million. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash outflows from financing activities were $1.91 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $1.02 billion net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The change was primarily due to $890 million increase in cash outflows from repayments of convertible and other debt, net of proceeds from issuances of convertible and other debt. See Note 10, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt obligations.
